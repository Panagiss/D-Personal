## Tips for Vegas/Defcon

##### To save money Vegas

- ATM's - use the ones not in casinos, like at a 7-11 or wallgreens. Avoid the fees
- Use the monorail - Look at the Def Con HDA web page for a discount code for a multi-day pass
- Don't even LOOK at the minibar in your hotel room. If you just pick something up and put it back they might charge you. Get snacks/drinks from 7-11/drugstores/etc
- Food courts can be a severe money drain - So are most places to eat inside of casinos. No joke - one place has a $80 large cheese pizza. Do NOT use the pizza slice vending machine. It's crap.
- If you gamble, so it sensibly.  
- Check youtube - there are people who are well known for scoping out the cheapest places to eat / drink in Vegas both on and off the strip.
- On the strip or Fremont St : DO NOT let anyone touch you , pose with you for a picture , hand you beads, a CD or anything. This is a known scam and they will make a scene unless you pay them for their picture, time, beads, cd etc..etc..
- Although they are disappearing , hotel buffets run mid week specials ~$30. Do not pay $50-$80-$100 for a hotel buffet unless it's the one in Paris. You do not want to spend Def Con in the bathroom.
- Beware hustlers selling VIP passes to clubs, line skipping services, etc. They are rarely worth it.
- When entering a hotel you may be hit up by time share people who offer you all kinds of things to watch a 1 hour presentation on a time share. No. No matter how good the deal seems, no.

##### Newbie advices [DEFCON](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-33/dc-33-index.html)

1. Turn off WiFi and Bluetooth and if you need WiFi only connect to the Defcon wifi (they will release the info and certs a few days before) on site, and if you're using your hotel make sure VPN is on 24/7 on both networks. Dont end up on the wall.

2. Sanitize if you want, but lets be honest... if you have a major company phone and it can't stand up to DC then thats a bigger issue. Its highly unlikely anyone will burn a zero day at such a sanitized event. Just be smart and turn off wifi, bluetooth, Airdrop, etc. Even off wifi keep VPN on just for that extra layer.

3. Download the HACKER TRACKER app closer to the event. Its just a Cyber Security conference app, but it'll be invaluable keeping track of things.

4. Go to said app a few days before DC when the talks are released, favorite all the shit you wan to see... then ignore it. Not even jokiing. If there's a major talk you want to see go for it, but dont manage yourself too much or you'll miss out. Enjoy the chaos of change the entire event. Dont make yourself stress getting from A to B and just enjoy the ride.

5. Don't be afraid to talk to people... legit, I went in only knowing one person and came out with a bunch of people I stay in touch with. There's also the Lonely Hackers Club to meet some peeps if you want to find others without a posse initially.

6. Stay near the Lightrail/Monorail since you said this is out of pocket. Get the 5 day pass and use it to get around town to DC33 and the various activities around the area by various groups. You can get cheaper off the strip but flip side if you want easy and non UBER stockpiling... staying near the LV Monorail makes it easy.

7. Have fun, man... legit. Its something you have to be there to understand, but just take it in. Grab swag. Go to the various villages (lockpick is always fun). Meet people. Pickup stickers. Go to talks... just go with the flow and find what you like but be open for anything to change on the fly.

8. Linecon - its a thing. If you want to meet people its a fun way.

9. Deodorant - Please wear it and shower daily. I mean, ultimately its up to you... but its a big event, and its August.

10. Thursday is basically badge and shop day. Honestly the line to get official merch can be 6-8hrs long (no joke, we got in about 9am and left at 430pm last year). If you want the official merch and you are a super small or large size... you might have to brave the line, but you can keep an eye on stock on the Hacker Tracker app. Its a day activity... take it or leave it. If you want the 4XL classic Cactus Jack shirt on your first visit... you're probably going to want to get there early for Linecon and go straight from badge to line and do it. After the first year, though... its really take it or leave it, and there are some great vendors on the floors with cool Defcon edition shirts and such.

Here I can find FAQ and it's the noob's guide:
https://lonelyhackers.club/defconguide/

Need to have for a US travel
- Travel adapter or two that is suitable for US plug sockets. [More info.](https://www.power-plugs-sockets.com/us/united-states-of-america/)
- Cash (USD) (anyone noticing a theme here?).
- US SIM card, or a decent roaming plan.
- Additionally, a credit or bank card for hotel payments.
- VISA to enter the country

##### Transportation in Vegas

https://www.reddit.com/r/Defcon/comments/1ip6lwg/can_anyone_help_me_arrange_transportation_for/

Monorail I think the best option if I manage to stay on the strip (road with all hotels).
Lyft/Uber is another option

##### Defcon Trainings/Workshops/Villages

**Trainings** are after Defcon (after sunday) and are expensive. They are equivalent to BH trainings. It's not worth my time. I should look for the workshops and villages.

**Villages** are focused topic areas spread throughout the con. Each village generally has a single assigned physical space to stay in. See the [DEF CON Villages page](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-32/dc-32-villages.html) for more information.


**Workshops** are (generally 4 hour) small, hands-on classes. Pre-registration is required in order to attend a workshop. This year they’re charging $25 on EventBrite to cut down on no-shows. If you want to get in, watch [@Defcon](https://twitter.com/defcon) for announcements on when the pre-reg will open. They go _very fast_. You’re competing with thousands of other excited hackers here, and space is extremely limited! Find out when registration opens and start refreshing.

If you are lucky enough to get into a workshop, bring your laptop: these are hands-on classes. The material for past workshops (and other assorted material) is online at [https://media.defcon.org/](https://media.defcon.org/).


DEF CON is all about the parties and there’s always going to be a ton. See [Parties, Meetups, & Events](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-32/dc-32-pmne.html) for the list.

##### LineCon

If you want a badge, get in line earlier rather than later, or you might just get a piece of paper instead. (Really.) The piece of paper will serve as your official DEF CON badge; this is just in event that they run out of the “normal Human” badges.

The long process of waiting in line to get your badge is affectionately known as “LineCon,” and it is (sadly?) not what it used to be. But it’s also kinda still a thing. Be prepared to hit beachballs into the air while drinking coffee. Maybe bring beer and make friends in line. You’ll have time to get to know them. :) Also, if you want official swag, get in that line ride early on Thursday, because swag sells out **fast**.


----
##### 3-2-1 Rule

These are minimums per day:

- 3 hours of sleep
- 2 meals
- 1 shower (**take a fucking shower and wear deodorant**)

---

##### \$\$\$\$ aka MONEY

Bring money (USD cash). More money (cash) than you think. OK, now bring just a little more cash. Keep going. Everything costs more than it should/you think it will in Vegas.

ATM fees are on the higher side and can add up pretty quickly. Fake ATMs were once a thing, but you’re now more likely to have someone shoulder surf your account info than haxor the ATM.

- DEF CON badge - $480 prereg, $460 cash
- Swag
    - Tshirt - $30-40
    - DEF CON bag - $60
    - DEF CON hat - $25-$40
    - Custom Badges - $5-$150
- Food
    - Meal at the Casino - $25-$infinity
    - Mixed drink at the Casino - $12-$20
    - Beer at the Casino - $8-12
    - Bottle of water at the Casino - $3-$10

----

##### Daily Loadout

Once again, leave your laptop in your room unless you know you’ll want/need it for a specific thing.

- Carry a battery pack and charger, a water bottle, and your phone, which will probably end up being the main way you find out about stuff going on at DEF CON “right now.”
- Carry cash – more than you think you need for all the cool shit you didn’t know you needed.
- Carry an ID for drinking, etc.

You might want a lightweight backpack or purse/messenger bag for all the stuff and swag/collectibles that you end up gathering throughout the day. If you’re going to use your normal backpack/messenger/purse, then do yourself a favor and empty it of the 50 lbs of excess crap that always accumulates, before DEF CON. You’ll be glad you aren’t carrying as much.


##### Medical Supplies/Medicine

It’s helpful to have medicine on you, or at least in your hotel room, so you don’t have to constantly make pharmacy runs. Having a first-aid kit on you is useful and can save lives too!

Good-to-haves:

- Pain relievers. Preferably NSAIDs (ibuprofen, Advil, Aspirin). acetaminophen/Tylenol/Paracetamol is strictly prohibited if you are or have recently been drinking.
- PediaLyte is your friend, or electrolyte (salt) tablets or drinks for dehydration/hangovers
- Sunscreen! If you’re outside for >2 min you will get burnt!
- Aloe Vera since you won’t listen about putting on sunscreen
- Zinc and vitamin C
- Motion sickness (anti-nausea) medicine (dramamine)
- Melatonin/5-HTP/Benedryl
- Tums/digestive aids
- Caffeine pills
- Band-aids
- Tissues
- Earplugs - some parties are **loud**
- Chap-stick
- Eye drops (the humidity is approx -9999%; your eyes will thank you)
- [Condoms, condoms, condoms](https://youtu.be/Si0JJE1rXWY?t=28)

##### Saving Money

- Organize a trip with friends to a grocery or store on or near the strip for bulk supplies and things like booze and bottled water/Gatorade ([Costco](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=costco+las+vegas) carries good cheap huge bottles of liquor, Walmart, CVS, Walgreens).
- Split cabs/Ubers/Lyfts _with people you know and trust_.
- Split rooms _with people you know and trust_.
- If you’re driving, make food and store it in a cooler instead of eating out.
- Use a refillable water bottle instead of buying new ones. Sometimes finding places to refill them can be obnoxiously difficult, but it’s not impossible.
- If you’re on a tight budget, you really don’t have to buy any t-shirts or swag. Your official DEF CON badge is the only purchase.

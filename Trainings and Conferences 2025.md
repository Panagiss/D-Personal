## Target Trainings


- Main one is OSCP from Offsec. The year subscription has around 2660 euros but can be done in a year with more easy pace. The cheaper sub has 1660euros but needs a hard push for three months. 
- Tenable training, it's already planned. For now is free and when specialized courses come, need to ask sales.
- Cortex XDR training - need to check that



## Conferences 

These is a list of indicative conferences that I would like to attend (Niels was up to for few of these):


- Black Hat USA, LV, 2-7 August. It has 4 days of training (you can choose few days if you want) and 2 days for the expo. For 4 days of training and the conference (so full schedule) it costs from 4.5k $ to 6k $
  
- Defcon 33, USA LV, 7-10 August. It actually follows Black Hat in the same venue. It's more focused on hackers and no commercial stuff take place. No third parties are allowed. 
  Costs 460$ for all the days.

- Brucon 2025, Netherlands, September (end)

- BSides Groningen (or other cities), Netherlands, 2nd May 

- Black Hat Europe (end of the year). No more info have been released yet


For me the top ones are Black Hat USA and Defcon 33 as the last one is following the first.
